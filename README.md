#### Installation

To get the app up and running on your device, a few installations are necessary.

* Install Android Emulator or an iOS Simulator(either one will do).

`code` $ git clone https://github.com/VidyaMuniraju/Binary-Chat.git

* Set up a firebase database for the app. For details [check this page.] (https://codinglatte.com/posts/how-to/how-to-create-a-firebase-project/)

* In the database’s project settings, under the general tab, choose Firestore for Web. Click Register and copy the configuration code into the app(find the variable firebaseConfig in the Chat.js file and replace your config key).
Set up the storage in your database to store the images.

* Change directory to the project directory, i.e., 
`code` $ cd Binary-Chat

This installs all the dependencies.
